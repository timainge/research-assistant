Process Rule (pin)
------------------
Stay focused on the current task. When new tasks or opportunities arise, log them below and defer until the active task is complete.

Backlog
-------
- Define core research workflows and initial scripts
- Add CI (formatting, linting, tests)
- Document environment management and secrets handling
- Outline MVP milestones in `notes/design.md`

Next Actions
------------
- (TBD) Pick the first research workflow to implement
